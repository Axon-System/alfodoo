The Alfodoo project
===================
The Alfodoo project has the objective to provide a collection of add-on in order to integrate the odoo platform with a Document Management System supporting the CMIS V1.1 protocol.

Currently, the project proposes integration between Odoo and the open-source ECM platform Alfresco.

The aim is to offer to the odoo users a transparent and easy access to the documents stored in the appropriate location in Alfresco. 

============================
Manage the documents in Odoo
============================

Visually the main part of the functionality is accessed through a "Document tab" configurable on each Odoo model providing a "real-time" view on the Alfresco content.

From the user point of view, the Document tab gives a direct access to the items (documents lists, sub-folders, â€¦) linked to the Odoo object and contained in the linked Alfresco folder.

The first action is to let the user creates manually  (means "only when needed") the linked folder in Alfresco

* **Show in Alfresco**:        This option opens Alfresco Share and shows the folder details page

In the content table, the User can see the documents and folders list.

The following information is displayed for each item:

* The item name

* Last Modified date
* A contextual menu: the options list for the a folder item or for a document item 

For a "Document" item, the following options are available:

	* **Update**: with this option the user can upload a new document in the folder. In case the document is associated with the Alfresco versionnable aspect Alfresco, the document version number (major) is automatically incremented.
	* **Delete**: delete the document
