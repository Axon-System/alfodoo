The CMIS Viewer is a powerful we widget for displaying and managing content
from a CMIS container linked to an Odoo model.

This Odoo add-on has a modular and generic core providing functionalities based
on the CMIS V1.1 protocol, with the ability to be extended with additional
modules for new features or customizations proper to a specific CMIS container.

The development of `Web CMIS Viewer` has been founded by `ACSONE SA/NV`_ and
is now maintained by `Odoo community Association (OCA)`_, and several
