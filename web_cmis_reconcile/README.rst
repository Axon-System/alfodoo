========================
CMIS documents reconcile
========================

This let's you link document from a folder into a CMIS container to an object
in Odoo. This process is driven by a wizard that scan the content of a specific
folder. For each document found in a format supported by the previewer, you
can link to an existing object in Odoo or create a new instance of a specific
model. As result, the document will be moved from the scanned folder to
the folder related to the Odoo object into CMIS.
